# LuceneNetDemo
A demo of using Lucene.NET 4.8

Clone this repository, compile and run. Then dig the code.

## API Key

You will need to obtain an API key from github to experience this demo in full. See instructions here: https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens.

The API Key is the first argument of the console application. If running on the command-line:

```
LuceneNetDemo.exe <Your API Key>
```

If running in Visual Studio:

1. Right-click the LuceneNetDemo project in Solution Explorer and choose "Properties".
2. Select the Debug tab.
3. Enter the API Key into the "Command line arguments:" textbox.
4. Press F5 to run the project.

## GitHub Organizations

For content to index, you will need a GitHub organization. There is a list of top organizations here: http://githubstats.lip.is/organizations/

Of course, if you can't decide, you can always use the "apache" organization and then search for "lucene".
